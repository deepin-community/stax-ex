Information about stax-ex
------------------------------

This package was debianized using the mh_make command
from the maven-debian-helper package.

The build system uses Maven but prevents it from downloading
anything from the Internet, making the build compliant with
the Debian policy.

Upstream does not provide a proper source tarball, so it's
created with 'debian/rules get-orig-source'.
